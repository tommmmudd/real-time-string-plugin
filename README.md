# real-time-string-plugin
Real time interactive port of a NESS String Model with fingers, fretboard and backboard.

Ported from code written by [Craig Webb](https://physicalaudio.co.uk/), developing earlier an earlier [NESS String](https://www.ness.music.ed.ac.uk/)


Current state:
 - prone to exploding: the string will need resetting in that case
 - there are some odd bugs in there still, e.g. lingering fingers


Note: the following parameters require the string to be reinitialised before being applied
 - length
 - tension
 - radius
 - decay
 - fret height
 - backboard height
